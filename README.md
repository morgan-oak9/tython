# Tython
Security as Code Framework

Tython is an open source security as code framework from [oak9](https://www.oak9.io) that lets you define security reference architectures as code (blueprints) in the language of your choice. Internally, oak9 uses this same framework to codify security blueprints that adhere to industry standard guidance from NIST, Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), AWS, Azure, GCP and others. This open source project enables developers and security professionals to build their own blueprints and contribute them back to the community.

## Getting Started
If you're interested in trying your hand at writing some security blueprints of your own and testing out the Tython framework, follow along with our Python example below. 

### Step 1: Get the Tython CLI
To get started writing your own security blueprints with the Tython framework, head to * to download and install the CLI. 

### Step 2: Initialize a Tython project utilizing the Python SDK

`tython init python`

### Step 3: Sign up for oak9 and create a project 
Mention 200 resource limit for Community edition

### Step 3a(optional): Fork one of the Terraoak repositories

### Step 4: Obtain an oak9 Tython API Key

`tython config`

### Step 5: Execute your blueprint against your IaC

### Step 6: Results in the oak9 console and remediation steps

## Guiding Principles

* Empower the community to collaborate, build, and share security best practices
* Strive for simplicity and extensibility
* Focus on value to security and dev teams
* Build reusable security reference architectures
* Create transparency in the security design
* Enable collaboration, autonomy, and shared responsibility across Dev and Security
* Consider the lifecycle management of security architectures
* Enable scalable security reference architectures
* Cloud and technology agnostic approach

## Background

Tython not only happens to be the birthplace of the Je'Daii Order (a precursor to the Jedi), it also is a portmanteau for the first two programming languages that we have built support for - Typescript and Python.
